expressblog
===========

A simple blog built with node-express-mongodb. After learning the <a href="http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb">Blog rolling with mongoDB, express and Node.js</a>, I built this simple blog just for practice.

This blog (http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb) built on express2, but now is express 3, so I have made some changes to get the blog done, mainly about the jade changes.

Installation
=====
+ run <code>npm install</code>
+ visit http://localhost:3000
